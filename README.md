🎯 Project Overview
Hyper-Composter BSFL Automaton is an IoT-enabled, biologically-driven waste processing unit that converts organic waste into high-value biomass using Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL). Unlike traditional composting (months), this system processes waste 50x faster while generating verifiable data for a Trace & Trade ecosystem.

🧪 How It Works
text
1. INPUT: Organic Waste (food scraps, kitchen waste)
   ↓
2. BSFL Processing: 90% volume reduction in 24-48 hrs
   ↓
3. OUTPUT: 
   • Frass (Premium Organic Fertilizer)
   • Pre-pupae (High-Protein Animal Feed)
   ↓
4. SENSOR DATA → Digital Ledger → Tradeable Credits
Optimal Conditions: 27-30°C | 60-70% Humidity | Aerobic Environment
